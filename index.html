    <h1>Stacks</h1>
    <p>
      Stacks are a data structure that store information in the form of a list.
      They allow only adding and removing elements under a LIFO pattern (last
      in, first out). In stacks, elements can't be added or removed out of
      order, <b>They always have to follow the LIFO pattern</b>
